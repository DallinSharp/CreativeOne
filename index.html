        <h1>What is Magic: the Gathering?</h1>
        <p>Magic: the Gathering is a card game in which two players (typically) take turns
          drawing and playing cards with different effects and abilities in order to lower
          their opponent's life total to 0 (or sometimes win in another way).</p>
        <p>The two major ways to play Magic: the Gathering are 1-Constructed, where you
          choose before playing which cards you want to play with, assemble a deck, and
          bring it to an event and 2-Limited, where you construct a deck on the fly with
          a limited and semi-randomized assortment of cards to choose from.</p>
        <p>Limited has a couple different ways to play, but we're here to give you tips
          about <em>drafting</em> where normally 8 players start with 3 unopened booster
          packs containing 15 cards each. To start off, each player opens their first
          booster pack and selects a single card, then passes that pack of cards to the
          player to their left. Continue picking one card at a time from the packs that
          are passed to you until there are no cards left in the first pack. After this,
          the process is repeated for each of the remaining two packs, except that players
          pass to the right instead of the left while drafting from the second pack.</p>
        <p>Every few months, a new pool of cards is released as a <em>set</em> and standard
          drafting events use booster packs that contain cards from the new set. Recently,
          the new set Theros Beyond Death was released, so there are a lot of new cards and
          choices to make while drafting. Use the links above to see what kinds of cards you
          should be looking out for in each color while drafting!</p>
